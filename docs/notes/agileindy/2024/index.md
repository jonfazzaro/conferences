According to *Accelerate*, teams that score high on DORA metrics are 2x more likely to meet their commercial **and** business goals.

### "Agile" has become hyperfocused on collecting underpants faster.

Traditional (physical) products improve through obsolescence and replacement. Software products improve in place.

Users aren't necessarily choosers--most Jira users can't opt out, it's what their org has chosen to use. (A corrallary or perversion of the network effect?)

|                                      | Phase 1                       | Phase 2        | Phase 3 |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|---------|
| (do we even understand the problem?) | ideas                         | customer value | profit  |
| Vision and Strategy                  | output                        | outcome        | impact  |
|                                      | (bad "Agile" gets stuck here) |                |         |

### We have a bias that our ideas are right.

Startup incubators are full of positive, bullish people, 90% of whom won't have a job a year from now.

IMPACT > velocity

MINIMIZE output, MAXIMIZE outcomes

(That's what the learning is for)

### Some questions to answer (with evidence!)

#### 1. Do you understand the *problem*?
#### 2. Will they want your solution?
#### 3. Can you build it predictably?
#### 4. Can people easily learn to use it?

Usability test your idea w/paper mockups--it's a cheap way to learn!

+ Visual fidelity is LOW
+ Data fidelity is OK
+ Functional fidelity is HIGH


#### 5. Will they *actually* use it?

Build it, but **not to scale**.

"Fake it, Build it, Ship it, Tweak it" (Spotify, 2014)

Release to learn (MVP)

âœ¨ NAIL IT BEFORE YOU SCALE IT

##### Tripadvisor's "404 Test" (2011)

A call to action shown on the site (temporarilty, for an hour or a day) would redirect to a 404 page, but log the click.

AKA a "painted door"

(Does this indicate *demand*, or merely *curiosity*?)
