# AgileDC

*Washington, DC*

## What about “those” people who won’t accept Agile?
with [MaryLynn Manns](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mary-lynn-manns-b592a8/)

*The day before this talk, MaryLynn’s home in Asheville, NC, had been devastated by Hurricane Helene. Yet here she was, giving this keynote.* 

*In fact, she was grateful to be out of town; her car, parked safely at the airport, had escaped the storm at home.*

[Fearless Change](https://fearlesschangepatterns.com) (w/Linda Rising) - tactical patterns for introducing new ideas

Powerless Leader (pattern): authority does not guarantee change.

### Kotter Change Model

1. **Create** a sense of urgency
2. **Build** a guiding coalition
3. **Form** a strategic vision
4. **Enlist** a volunteer army
5. **Enable** action by removing barriers
6. **Generate** short-term wins
7. **Sustain** acceleration
8. **Institute** change

During times of change, people lose their identity and their ability to predict the future. They often react by trying to take control of *something* to retain these, however unproductive the results may be.

### Patterns

+ Elevator pitch
+ Wake up call
+ Shoulder to cry on (acknowledge what they could lose)
+ Emotional connection
+ Personal touch
+ Imagine that
+ Hometown story
+ Fear Less (what is their attractor?)
+ Champion skeptic
+ Whisper in the General's ear (Linda referenced this one [here](../../aab/2022/index.md#day-2-keynote-how-to-talk-to-the-elephant), remember?)
+ Pick your battles

✨ Organizational change is a strange term--orgs don't change, people do. One at a time.

What's more important: changing their mind, or your relationship with them?
