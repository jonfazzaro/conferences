## Blending Product Thinking with Architecture

with [Joel Tosi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-tosi-531a3b/)

### Strategic DDD

+ draw boundaries in the system (for example) by user status (lead, prospect, trial, customer, whale)
+ event storming

### [C4 modeling](https://c4model.com) 

"The right story at the right level"

+ Context, 
+ Containers, 
+ Components, and
+ Code (<-- "I don't diagram this last one, the code is the doc")

**C* maps nicely to the testing pyramid**. A small number of end-to-end tests at the Context level, several integration tests at the Container and Component levels, and loads of unit tests at the Code level.

DDD Domains are found at the C2 level.

"If you can't think of any ways you could go wrong, you're going to go wrong in a *glorious* way."

Architecture is no one's job. It's an act of communication.

## Creative Problem Solving

with [Eric Potter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericbpotter)

> Ideas are just networks of other ideas.

--Steven Johnson, ðŸ“˜ [How We Got to Now](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20893477-how-we-got-to-now)

New gen of note-taking apps (Obsidian, Notion, LogSeq, etc) help their users exploit this idea.

"Exocortex" (ðŸ“˜ [Pragmatic Thinking & Learning](https://pragprog.com/titles/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning/))

Start with the *worst possible* idea.

Be intellectually humble AND confident in your ability.

## Can We Learn to Manage Uncertainty? Probably!

with [Robert Herbig](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertherbig)

"I don't know" is a powerful statement.

Plan and communicate in terms of **bets**. Every bet has a cost, a likelihood of success, and an outcome.

There is always a tradeoff between [precision vs. accuracy](https://xkcd.com/2696/).

ðŸ“˜ [Thinking in Bets](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35957157-thinking-in-bets) by Annie Duke

**"Resulting"**. A poker term of art for getting a good outcome from a poor decision (or vice versa). The ends don't justify the means!

**Decouple luck from skill** when telling the story of what happened.

**Belief is involuntary comprehension**--we buy it before we try it. "Smart" people are often just better at rationalizing their existing beliefs.

ðŸ“˜ [The Believing Brain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9754534-the-believing-brain) by Michael Shermer

"Truthseeking" - purposefully updating your beliefs. 

Leverage gut/System 1/Elephant: "would you bet your house on it?"

People who are labeled "smart" tend to avoid doing anything they're not already good at.
