## The Cinderella of Security - Combining forces with compliance for better security outcomes
with [Kendra Ash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kendraash)

There is no such thing as 100% compliance. 

Compliance personnel are often non-technical in background. Compliance controls are not only open to interpretation, they must be interpreted to be implemented (like any other software requirement)

This interpretation is a creative act, and is where we can choose who we are to the compliance Cinderella: her Stepsisters, or her Fairy Godmother.

## Authorization: the next platform service
with [Ronen Hilewicz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronenhilewicz/)

*Authentication* is a solved problem. *Authorization* is not.

Authorization is, in fact, [the #1 problem](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/) on the OWASP Top Ten!

### It's a much harder problem to solve.  
Authentication happens once, up-front, as you enter a session  
Authorization happens constantly, throughout the user's session, in real-time

### Evolution of Authorization techniques

ACL  
RBAC  
ABAC (Policy as code)   
ReBAC (Policy as data)
