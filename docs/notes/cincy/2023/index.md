### Agile Coaching

+ Requires the emotional intelligence to influence without authority
+ Professional coaching only accounts for about 5% of the work

### Impediments to agility at scale

+ inconsistency
+ hyperfocus
+ lack of purpose
+ lack of engagement

+ A coach *doesn't need to know everything* to be effective.

+ Agile Coaches spend a significant amount of energy justifying our existence and expense.

### A structured approach

+ organizational objectives (not "Agile")
+ set in a contract, with a timebox
+ make a plan to achieve them
+ establish communication channels
+ standardize the basics
    + definition of done
    + practices needed to solve problems

### How do we get managers to embrace coaches + coaching?

Use Scrum as a vehicle for agility *if that's what they're already using*

We tend to focus on team coaching first, but that may not be the right place to start. Managers tend to respond to PowerPoint (lol)

Scaling builds a coaching competency, not just a team-level coaching engagement for a team that may only end up disbanded.
