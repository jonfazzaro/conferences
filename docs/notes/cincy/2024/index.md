## Is Everyone AI-ing Without Me? A .NET Developers Guide to Development with AI

with [J. Tower](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtower/)

## Better Remote Teamwork through Emotional Intelligence

with [Ben Friedberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-friedberg/)

Elevate each other. Make someone else the smartest person in the room.

### Working Agreements

|      | Tradition | Innovation |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **Love** | keep      | try        |
| **Hate** | stop      | ?          |

A totem (e.g. ELMO, short for "Enough, let's move on") can be a quick reminder of a working agreement. But using one can also be taken as passive-aggressive.

### Meetings

20m or 50m--allow for breaks!

Along with a meeting agenda, include a bit about "why you shouldn't attend", to give people permission to opt-out.

Hide self-view (but check for food in your teeth first)

## Creating Your First AI-Based Product

with [Rich Theil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richtheil/), founder of productforge.ai

Don't get distracted by the shiny--is the product impressive, or just the AI behind it?

Do things that don't scale: manually prompt GPT and offer the results to your customer for feedback.

AI is like a 4yo who knows everything.

Groq (not Grok from X) is fast, but doesn't scale

Cost--pay per tokens in/out

### OpenAI has a variable Temperature 

2.0 is maximum creativity/chaos/variability  
1.0 is normal  
0.0 is deterministic

When retrieving data, dial the Temperature way down. OR store the data separately and inject into the response.

**Embeddings** are vectorized data, a mathematical representation of the *meaning* of a word/sentence. Digitized semantics of analog language.

In about 5 years, most of us will be directing multiple agents doing work for us, and we'll need to discern whether the results are correct. (like reviewing PRs from an off-shore development team, and probably just as frustrating)

## Returning to Tech... Twice

with [Ashley Stove](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aastove/)

Leadership is adaptation. Everyone expects to be led in a different way.

Balance IQ, EQ, and CQ (Cultural IQ)

### When job searching

Reflect and write.

#### The 15-10-2 method
Every day:

+ identify **15** New Resources
+ make **10** Contacts
+ hold **2** Face-to-Face Meetings or Interviews

In interviews, tell stories about your work using the [STAR format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation%2C_task%2C_action%2C_result) (Situation, Task, Action, Result).

### On teaching

Teach programming by showing students how to google. (e.g., "how to declare a var in Java")

### On competency

[Korn/Ferry FYI](https://www.kornferry.com/fyi-resources)

"If you overuse collaboration to where you can no longer work on your own, that's not a competency." ðŸ¤”

WWII Plane spotters trained for pattern recognition (like with the [Sparrow Decks](https://llewellynfalco.blogspot.com/p/sparrow-decks.html))
