AI right now is like the Internet in the early 1990s.

### AI with .NET
+ Azure AI services (fka Cognitive Services) provide AIaaS, MLaaS
+ In code, ML.NET and Custom Copilots
+ Azure and OpenAI APIs do not use your data for training, and you can opt out of data retention

+ An LLM must be run online, whereas a "reasonably-sized" LM can be run locally.

### ML.NET
+ runs without a live connection
+ use to train a custom model
+ [J on ML.NET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWCqryuCJS8) on the Blue Blazes podcast

### Visual Studio ML Builder
+ generates model as a .zip
+ `MlContext.Model.Load(zip)`

+ Semantic Kernel is the corelib of MS copilots
+ Cognitive Toolkit is for creating custom Neural Networks (for more power and control)

Leadership is adaptation. Everyone expects to be led in a different way.

Balance IQ, EQ, and CQ (Cultural IQ)

### When job searching

Reflect and write.

#### The 15-10-2 method
Every day:

+ identify **15** New Resources
+ make **10** Contacts
+ hold **2** Face-to-Face Meetings or Interviews

In interviews, tell stories about your work using the [STAR format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation%2C_task%2C_action%2C_result) (Situation, Task, Action, Result).

### On teaching

Teach programming by showing students how to google. (e.g., "how to declare a var in Java")

### On competency

[Korn/Ferry FYI](https://www.kornferry.com/fyi-resources)

"If you overuse collaboration to where you can no longer work on your own, that's not a competency." ðŸ¤”
